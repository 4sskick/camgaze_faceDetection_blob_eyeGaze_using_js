## Implementation

**Camgaze.js** goes through two steps in order to predict the gaze direction. Firstly, **Camgaze.js** detects each pupil. It then uses the pupils deviation from a unique point on the face to determine the gaze metric, *G*. This metric needs to be calibrated so there is a mapping from *G* to a point on the screen.
